Changes and version history
===========================

gmx4.5-1.4 (2011-01-19)

   - various adaptations to the Gromacs 4.5.3 code base
     (bool-->gmx_bool, use oenv in parse_common_args(), ...)

gmx4.0-1.3a (2010-10-13)

   - Hopefully improved installation instructions. You still have to
     edit Makefile but you can also run make check to check if the
     Gromacs libraries and include files have been found.

gmx4.0-1.2 (2010-08-05)

   - fixed a name clash between 'dprintf' in utilgmx.h and
     /usr/include/stdio.h; apparently, this is defined on 
     newer Linux systems (reported by Jayne Wallace)

gmx4.0-1.1 (2010-03-03)

   - rearranged directory structure (src/, scripts/ include/
     directories)
   - removed compiling as 'Contributed Software'

gmx4.0-1.0 (2010-02-18)

   - compiles with Gromacs 4.0.x but has less functionality
   - one can only count atoms, not molecules (the -m flag of
     the previous versions is disabled).
   - changed the version numbering to indicate the Gromacs release
  

1.1.3 (2008-05-08)
  
   - compiles with Gromacs 3.3.3 (tested on Mac OS X). (Sorry, I don't
     have the time to make versions properly backward compatible with
     older Gromacs versions. Just email me if you have problems.)


1.1.1 (2007-05-16)

   - version was quickly modified to compile with Gromacs 3.3.1
     (tested on Mac OS X). Because it uses gmx_fatal() instead of
     fatal_error() it probably won't compile with older Gromacs
     versions (pre 3.3 I imagine).


1.0 (2006-01-10)

   - version of these programs were compiled and tested with Gromacs
     3.1.4 and Gromacs 3.2.1 under Red Hat 8.0 Linux and Debian Linux.
