Changes and version history
===========================

gmx4.0-1.1

   - rearranged directory structure (src/, scripts/ include/
     directories)
   - removed compiling as 'Contributed Software'

gmx4.0-1.0 

   - compiles with Gromacs 4.0.x but has less functionality
   - one can only count atoms, not molecules (the -m flag of
     the previous versions is disabled).
   - changed the version numbering to indicate the Gromacs release
  

1.1.3 
  
   - compiles with Gromacs 3.3.3 (tested on Mac OS X). (Sorry, I don't
     have the time to make versions properly backward compatible with
     older Gromacs versions. Just email me if you have problems.)


1.1.1 

   - version was quickly modified to compile with Gromacs 3.3.1
     (tested on Mac OS X). Because it uses gmx_fatal() instead of
     fatal_error() it probably won't compile with older Gromacs
     versions (pre 3.3 I imagine).


1.0 

   - version of these programs were compiled and tested with Gromacs
     3.1.4 and Gromacs 3.2.1 under Red Hat 8.0 Linux and Debian Linux.
