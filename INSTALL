Compatibility with Gromacs
==========================

Every version of Gromacs introduces some changes that lead to some
incompatibilities. Therefore, there are specific version of gridcount
for different versions of Gromacs.

The gridcount  version that comes with this file is for stable

    Gromacs 4.0.x

releases.

Other version of gridcount can be found on the website (see README).




Installation and Compilation 
============================

In order to compile the code you need to have the Gromacs include
files and libgmx and libmd installed.

Both programs utilise a number of common routines so it was natural to
bundle them in a small library, libgridcount. 


In order to compile the programs in this directory on their own you
will need an existing gromacs installation, i.e. the header files and
the libmd and libgmx libraries.

(1) Edit `Makefile (perhaps different BIN_DIR path for
    install, location of the libgmx and libmd libraries and header
    files, ...)

    `make help' shows your current settings.

(2) Compile the programs
    
       make

(3)  Install
      
       make install

    

Problems 
========

* xdr system header files not found
  - If compiling standalone make sure that your compiler can find the
    xdr header files which do exist on most systems (if you managed to
    compile gromacs in any case). /usr/include/rpc seems a standard
    location.

    However, if you managed to compile gromacs then I suggest you
    compile gridcount simply as contributed software as described
    above and everything should sort out itself.

  - Campbell Millar <c.millar@elec.gla.ac.uk> reports that on Apple,
    Solaris and SGI some typedefs were missing. If you seem to have
    this problem try patching xdr_grid.h by issuing
