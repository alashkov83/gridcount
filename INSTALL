Compatibility with Gromacs
==========================

Every version of Gromacs introduces some changes that lead to some
incompatibilities. Therefore, there are specific version of gridcount
for different versions of Gromacs.

The gridcount  version that comes with this file is for stable

    Gromacs 4.5.x

releases.

Other version of gridcount can be found on the website (see README).




Installation and Compilation 
============================

In order to compile the code you need to have the Gromacs include
files and libgmx and libmd installed.

Both programs utilise a number of common routines so it was natural to
bundle them in a small library, libgridcount. 


In order to compile the programs in this directory on their own you
will need an existing gromacs installation, i.e. the header files and
the libmd and libgmx libraries.

(0) Figure out where Gromacs is installed on your system; you need to
    know the full path to the include directory and to the library
    directory.

    1. include directory: The directory that contains the files
       xtcio.h, gmx_ana.h, atomprop.h, ...

       On a default installation of Gromacs this would be 
       '/usr/local/gromacs/include/gromacs'.

    2. lib directory: The directory that contains the files
       libgmx.a or libgmx.so or libgmx.dylib

       On a default installation of Gromacs this would be
       '/usr/local/gromacs/lib'.

(1) Edit 'Makefile':
    
    1. Set 'GMX_INCLUDE_DIR' to the include directory found in Step 0.1

    2. Set 'GMX_LIB_DIR' to the library dirctory found in Step 0.2

    3. Set 'BIN_DIR' to a directory where you want to install the compiled
       binaries; you will need write access to the directory.

    `make help' shows your current settings.

    `make check' tries to determine if you set the variables
    correctly; please read the output carefully.

(2) Compile the programs
    
       make

(3)  Install
      
       make install

Example:

You can also forego editing the top-level Makefile and set important
paths on the command line. For instance, if you installed Gromacs in
/opt/gromacs then you would (probably) say

  make GMX_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/gromacs/include/gromacs GMX_LIB_DIR=/opt/gromacs/lib

and then install it in your private bin directory

  make BIN_DIR=$HOME/bin install

(For more detailed explanations see the top of the top-level Makefile.)
    

Problems 
========

* compilation fails with 

   gcc -g -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-functions -funroll-loops -Wall -Wno-unused  -I/usr/local/gromacs/include  -c -o g_ri3Dc.o g_ri3Dc.c
   g_ri3Dc.c:101:22: error: statutil.h: No such file or directory
   g_ri3Dc.c:102:22: error: sysstuff.h: No such file or directory
   ...

  This means that you did not edit the Makefile (steps 1.1 and 1.2).
  Go back and do it. Try `make check'; it should only report 'ok'.

* xdr system header files not found
  - If compiling standalone make sure that your compiler can find the
    xdr header files which do exist on most systems (if you managed to
    compile gromacs in any case). /usr/include/rpc seems a standard
    location.

    However, if you managed to compile gromacs then I suggest you
    compile gridcount simply as contributed software as described
    above and everything should sort out itself.

  - Campbell Millar <c.millar@elec.gla.ac.uk> reports that on Apple,
    Solaris and SGI some typedefs were missing. If you seem to have
    this problem try patching xdr_grid.h by issuing
