gridcount Howto
===============

Simple example: generate the water density and display in VMD
-------------------------------------------------------------

First you will need to have a trajectory that is centered on the
protein (or whatever you are interested in; see the :doc:`FAQ` for
details). E.g. ::

   trjconv -s md.tpr -fit rot+trans -f md.xtc -o md_fit.xtc

(Ideally, fit to a protein that is already centred in the box.)

Make an index file for the water oxygen atoms::

   printf  "keep 0\ndel 0\na OW\nq\n" | make_ndx -f md.tpr -o ow.ndx

Generate the OW-density on 1 Å grid (=0.1 nm in Gromacs units!)::

   g_rid3Dc -s md.tpr -f md_fit.xtc -delta 0.1 0.1 0.1 -grid water_density.dat

Convert the density to a gOpenMol density file::

   a_ri3Dc -unit molar -grid water_density.dat -plt plt_water_density.dat
   mv plt_water_density.dat water_density.plt

Notes:

  * Using -unit molar produces a density (or concentration) in
    mol/l; the concentration of bulk water is about 55 mol/l.

  * Because of short comings in my Gromacs coding skills you will
    have to manually rename the plt file so that it has the proper
    suffix. 


View structure and density in VMD:

   vmd md.gro -m water_density.plt

Use the Representation view to change the appearance of the density.
